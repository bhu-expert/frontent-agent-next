# Contributing to plug and play agents v2

Welcome to plug and play agents v2! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our codebase. Please review the following guidelines before submitting any code.

## Code Style Rules

We enforce a strict and modern development environment to ensure long-term stability:

- **TypeScript Strictness**: We compile with strict mode enabled.
- **No `any` Types**: Do not bypass the type system. You must strictly define your interfaces or use `unknown` if truly dynamic, forcing type guards later.
- **Utility Purity**: Files within the `lib/` directory must utilize Named Exports exclusively. They must remain pure logic boundaries (No React, No JSX).

## Branch Naming Convention

Please prefix your branches correctly to help orchestrate CI workflows:

- `feat/` — For all brand new features or significant components. (e.g., `feat/linkedin-templates`)
- `fix/` — For patching bugs or state issues. (e.g., `fix/auth-modal-overflow`)
- `chore/` — For dependency updates, typo fixes, or minor configuration adjustments.

## Commit Message Format

plug and play agents v2 uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` A new feature.
- `fix:` A bug fix.
- `docs:` Documentation only changes.
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

Example: `feat: add Google OAuth support to login modal`

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure your branch successfully answers true to the following requirements:

- [ ] **TypeScript Clean**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and ensure zero errors are reported.
- [ ] **ESLint Clean**: General linting must pass cleanly (`npm run lint`).
- [ ] **Tests Passing**: Playwright E2E tests must execute successfully (`npm run test:e2e`).
- [ ] **Clean Console**: Remove all temporary `console.log`, `console.warn`, or debugging statements before committing.

## The Frozen Zone: DO NOT EDIT

Certain architectural boundaries within this application are considered fundamentally feature-complete or strictly managed.

Unless explicitly approved via an architecture review issue, do **not** edit:

- Any component residing in `components/landing/`
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx`

If you feel changes are necessary here, open a Discussion thread first.
